  <h1>What makes art ART  </h1>
	
    <p>Many people do not consider themselves artists, often feeling that art requires a <strong>special talent</strong> or <strong>training that they lack</strong>. However, I believe that everyone possesses the innate ability to create <strong>art</strong> and should be encouraged to do so.<br>
	Art is not confined to traditional forms like painting or sculpture; it can be expressed through various mediums such as writing, cooking, gardening, or even problem-solving. The act of creating <strong>art</strong> is a powerful means of <strong>self-expression</strong> and <strong>personal growth</strong>,<br>
	allowing individuals to convey emotions, tell stories, and connect with others on a deeper level. By embracing our creative potential, we can discover new passions, reduce stress, and enhance our overall well-being. <br>
	Ultimately, the world would be a richer, more vibrant place if everyone recognized and nurtured their <strong>inner artist.</strong></p>
